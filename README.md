VECTOR STORM

A schmup currently in development hell. Orignally a project initiated by our experimental indie game studio Divide by Zero Studios, the endeavor was soon abandoned due to conflicting obligations among the three developers.

I've taken it under my belt to transcribe the original beta that was written in BASIC to C++. Present is only the source code, makefiles, and object files of the C++ version - the BASIC code is privately archived. I plan on having a downloadable zip that contains the audio and images necessary to run the build sometime in the future, when I feel the code has sufficiently progressed.

Using the openFrameworks libraries.
